# ETL_Spar_nord_bank
In my project, Spar Nord Bank is trying to observe the withdrawal behaviour and the corresponding dependent factors to optimally manage the refill frequency. Apart from this, other insights also have to be drawn from the data.


Coming to the analysis part, you will be tasked to carry out the calculations to perform the following analytical queries:

Top 10 ATMs where most transactions are in the ’inactive’ state

Number of ATM failures corresponding to the different weather conditions recorded at the time of the transactions

Top 10 ATMs with the most number of transactions throughout the year

Number of overall ATM transactions going inactive per month for each month

Top 10 ATMs with the highest total amount withdrawn throughout the year

Number of failed ATM transactions across various card types

Top 10 records with the number of transactions ordered by the ATM_number, ATM_manufacturer, location, weekend_flag and then total_transaction_count, on weekdays and on weekends throughout the year

Most active day in each ATMs from location "Vejgaard"
